# Tangerine Network Council Guideline

## **Objective**

The Tangerine Network Council is the organization that governs, maintains, operates and drives the Tangerine Network.

## **Background**

Tangerine Network is a community-driven blockchain network that is developed by Byzantine Lab based on DEXON Consensus<sup>[1](#dexon-consensus)</sup> and gdex<sup>[2](#gdex)</sup> codebase. Tangerine Network aims to serve as a business-ready blockchain infrastructure with high throughput (10K TPS), low latency (1s) and byzantine fault tolerance. To build a decentralized network, it is the community that should own the network instead of a single company. Considering both efficiency and decentralization, as we did in blockchain consensus, a rather small part of the community will form an organization that governs, maintains, operates and drives the Tangerine Network, a.k.a. Tangerine Network Council.

## **Overview**

This document will specify the very first version of the guidelines and obligations of the council, including how to select council members, how to make decisions, what the council and members are responsible for.

## Guidelines

### Member Election

Council members will be elected by all block proposers. Block proposers’ voting power is proportional to the number of nodes, which means one node, one vote. An individual or an organization that runs at least one BP node can apply for candidacy. The total number of council members is one-third of the numbers of BP nodes.

### Motions

A motion that meets the following criteria will be an official resolution from the council.

- Two-thirds of council members should vote.
- The majority of the participants should vote for the resolution.

## Obligations

### Partner Vesting Review

Every half-year, the council shall review and decide the TAN should be vested to node partners, following the council guidelines for resolution determination.

### Budget Review

The reserved TAN and any other fiat or crypto assets of the council are used for the development, maintenance, operation and promotion of Tangerine Network and the council. It is the council’s responsibility to review budgets and executions.
